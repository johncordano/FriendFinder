# Friend Finder

In this application, users access an online form and answer questions about themselves. The user answers are stored in a JavaScript file. After submitting the form, users are provided a name and photo of another user who might be compatible with them. The compatible user's answers in the online form most closely match the user's answers.

The application is deployed at: https://friendfindercordano.herokuapp.com/
